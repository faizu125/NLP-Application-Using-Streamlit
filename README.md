Language Translation: Translates text between multiple languages.

Text Classification: Categorizes text into predefined labels (e.g., spam detection).

Plagiarism Detection: Ensures content originality using cosine similarity.

Search History: Stores and retrieves past queries for easy access.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Framework: Streamlit

Pre-trained Models: Hugging Face Transformers

Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

Algorithms: Cosine Similarity for plagiarism detection

API Integration: Gemini API for dynamic chatbot functionality
